## Goals

- Get our projects moving toward sharing and reuse
- Discuss how we will work together
- Surface any assumptions we have about our project work
- Start thinking about how we will know our work is resuable

@title[Why are we here?]

[Beyond Open Source](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/11148)

Note:
Just to give you an idea of some of the work we've done in this area, I'm going to talk about Suma, our open source assessment toolkit and thinking we've done around software availability.

@title[Quote 1]

"Who would be the best person on your team to talk with about the technical requirements and skills needed for us to install SUMA and get it up and running. For example, do we need a computer programmer with such and such skills &hellip; I am not sure we have the expertise in-house."

Note:
The following quote is from an email from a librarian at a research university seeking to install Suma (used with permission).

"Who would be the best person on your team to talk with about the technical requirements and skills needed for us to install SUMA and get it up and running. For example, do we need a computer programmer with such and such skills. I’m sure you have good documentation available, however, we would like to talk with someone. We are also curious as to how much time it would take to get SUMA working for us. I am not sure we have the expertise in-house."

@title[Quote 2]

"Ultimately, I didn’t want to get on our IT support’s bad side and because I’m not allowed to play with our development servers I can’t exactly go at the installation process alone."

Note:
And from a librarian at a research university (also used with permission) on canceling a pilot Suma evaluation:

@title[Software Availability]

## Stopwatch Technology Availability Performance Indicators

Note:
Our goal now is to find methods for measuring the maturity, or availability, of our software as well as techniques for improving those measures. Examples from our work include time to pilot on laptop, time to export data, time to upgrade, etc. How will reusability of our grant projects be measured? What are the criteria for success?

## Software Maturity

[Performance on a many-membered Sufia/Hyrax show page](https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/performance-on-a-many-membered-sufiahyrax-show-page/)

Note:
Recent blog post from Jonathan Rochkind https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/performance-on-a-many-membered-sufiahyrax-show-page/ lamented the lack of maturity in many library software projects.

@title[Software Maturity Description]
## From Stack Overflow:
1. People know how to use it and its limitations
1. People know what the typical usage scenarios are
1. There is a community of knowledge to deal with limitations/bugs
1. The technology is trusted enough to be used by individuals AND institutions

@title[Discussion]

What **approaches** will you take with your own projects to achieve reuse?

What **challenges** do you think you'll face to allowing for reuse?

Note:
One of the goals of the grant is to make your outputs shareable and reusable outside of your own institution and to build a community of practice around sharing and reuse.
